# Android Audio Replacer
- A simple Magisk module that detects the location of Android system sounds to replace them.

Just place the audios you want to replace in the "Audio" folder, respect the original paths.
In "Releases" you will find a sample module that replaces some sounds with ones extracted from the DerpFest ROM.
